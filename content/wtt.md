### I worried about my 4-year plan so much that you won't have to.

(Scroll down for the TL;DR)

With the influx of freshmen came a wave of asking for class recommendations and 4 year plans. Having worried about my own way too much (in terms of graduating on time, optimizing the # of classes I took, figuring out what I actually am interested in), I compiled a list of all the courses I've taken or plan to take. 

As a note to preface the below, I'd say that it'll probably only be useful for people early on at Vanderbilt - by the time you grow a more solid understanding of what intrigues you / what you want do pursue in your life, you probably no longer need these heuristics to figure your coursework out.

I think the biggest thing that helped me was deciding what I wanted to do (somewhat) early on. Sure, I came into college Econ/Public Policy, and ended up switching to CS/Math a semester and a half in, but still managed to pursue my concurrent Masters as well has have a handful of 12 hour semesters. 

Also, another note - there is a ridiculous amount of overlap between the CS primary/Math secondary coursework - I figured out that with the Calc sequence + a few electives done from APs, that if you ended up taking all your CS electives to be math electives, you kind of just end up with a second major in math. Kind of neat.

Figuring out what I wanted to do early on meant that most of my time was spent taking the incredibly interesting classes, or the prereqs for those courses, and that the rest of the gaps were filled in with my core requirements. 

Once you reach a certain level of courses, however, you'll find that some classes are only offered certain semesters (once every four semesters, etc.). This meant that a lot of the times, I'd have to schedule my electives/prereqs super well or self study material to skip to the stuff I actually find interesting or learn from the stars of the Vanderbilt faculty, rather than wait another 2 years for the stars to align and take the course then.

This approach may or may not be advisable depending on your learning style. I ended up having multiple 17-18 hour semesters (including one where I juggled 3 math and 3 CS courses in one semester). Do I regret it? Absolutely not. My college education (to me) seemed a lot more engaging than that of my friends, and I learned that overloading on credits is actually not as suffocating as people made it out to be.

This approach also might not be advisable if you're interested in other majors, or considering applying to Medical School or other graduate schools with tons of requirements. If this is you, you'll likely have a lot more rigidity in your course selection that I did.

This approach worked out well for me, someone who leans on the side of taking advanced, time-consuming classes that are more interesting than the easy-A, sleeper classes. 

The approach in the other direction, the one that is generally more popular and what most upperclassmen and advisors will tell you, is to take introductory level classes that satisfy requirements for whatever school and major you're in, and pick electives to scope out your interests before commiting to something. An important thing to consider, however, is that not only do more advanced classes dive deeper and more intimately into these topics, but the support system for them is a lot stronger as well, compared to the 100+ person intro classes that (most of the time) feel very impersonal. Also, taking higher level classes early (or even at all) surrounds you with the smartest, hardest-working people that your class or college has to offer, and just being around them is a blessing in and of itself to your motivation and view towards education.

You also should consider coursework and majors factoring other things you might want to do on campus (clubs, studying abroad, doing a Masters or second major, research, athletics, mental health). CS + Math happened to work well for me despite a (somewhat) late start to the major, as Math requirements were low and I still had time to do a Masters AND have 12 hour semesters. I also am doing research on campus in stastical forecasting and modeling, and being able to take the higher level graduate courses out of sequence helped prime me / let me pick up what I needed to be successful in the position. 

Finally, take this all with a grain of salt. A lot of this won't end up mattering in the grand scheme of things. I've taken the "wrong" classes and still have gotten a lot out of them, and have taken some classes that I really believed were interesting, only to change my mind halfway through the semester. I have friends to have changed majors multiple times (I changed, like, 3 times in my first year), and still have ended up working things out in time. Obviously figuring your life out is really important, but if you find that you dislike a major (which usually leads to doing poorly or being mediocre in the long run), try to leave as soon as you can.

I ended up taking two economics course and a classics class my first semester. I dropped economics as a major within a month, and still have no idea why I took the classics class. I ended up fine, and I still thoroughly enjoyed the classes. Sure, I eventually doubled down on my interests, but if you're worried about your freshman year coursework, chances are, you're going to be fine academically, whether you take Course A or Course B. There's a system that keeps you afloat no matter what at Vanderbilt, and you won't ever realize that it's there.

One final thing: if you can, being a broad, general person could be best, especially if you're an interdisciplinary person. Obviously this statement would carry a lot more weight from someone who went to a truly liberal arts college. However, the classes where I learned theoretical frameworks/concepts were better for my mental development than what I could've done on my own.

Choosing "general" curricula doesn't necessitate a particular discipline, but rather how classes are taught. CS and Math happened to be two of the disciplines where this is more often the case. I liked a lot of the general or theoretical abstractions in math despite being bad with them, and lots of people better-versed than I have spoken at length about the values of learning math in college, even if you don't stay in the discipline. 

#### Courses

##### Computer Science

Computer science core at Vanderbilt is boring and ugly, but it prepares you well for a career in computer science. However, if you're truly looking for a way to explore the areas you're interested in within the realm of CS, I highly recommend 1) doing research in a field you're interested in, and 2) taking graduate level courses, even if you're not doing a Masters.

Step 1: Start with core, take it whenever you can. Plan around any prereqs / other plans, such as studying abroad, a second major, etc. Will be hard to get into classes until 3rd year.

Step 2: You're likely starting your depth. Figure out your interests, and take the classes that you think will help you explore them. Some rough guidelines are:
1. AI/ML: CS: {3891: Reinforcement Learning, 3892: ML Project, 4260: AI, 4262: ML, 4267: Deep Learning, 4269: AI Project, 6350: Artificial Neural Networks, 6360: Advanced AI, 6362: Advanced ML, 6366: Distributed AI, 8395: Representation Learning, selected topics in DL}.
2. Systems/Architecture: CS: {3253: Parallel Functional Programming, 3254: Concurrent OOP, 3276: Compiler Construction, 4278: SWE, 4278: SWE Project, 4283: Computer Networks, 4284: Computer Systems Analysis, 4286: Cybersecurity, 4287: Cloud Computing, 4288: WebDev, 4289: WebDev Project}.
3. Animation, VR: CS: {3258: Computer Graphics, 3259: Animation Project, 3274: Modeling and Sim, 4249: VR Project}
4. Medical Image Analysis: CS: {6357: Open-source Programming for Medical Image Analysis, 6358: Computer Vision, 6359: Medical Image Registration}.

Step 3: Graduate.

##### Math

If you want math classes that also count for your CS depth, take MATH: {3320: Error-Correcting Codes and Cryptography, 3620: Intro to Numerical Mathematics, 4620: Linear Optimization}.

If you're interested in financial mathematics (quant? mathematical finance? stats?), take MATH: {3640: Probability, 3641: Mathematical Statistics, 3650: Intro to Financial Math, 4650: Financial Stochastic Processes, 4651: Evaluation of Actuarial Models}.

If you're interested in pure math, take MATH: {3100/6100/6101: Real Analysis, 3200/4200/4201: Topology, 3300/4300/4301: Algebra, Complex Analysis, Fourier Analysis, etc.}.

If you're mainly an engineering student, take MATH: {3630: Mathematical Bio, 4110: PDEs, 4610: Mathematical Physics, 4710: Graph Theory}.
